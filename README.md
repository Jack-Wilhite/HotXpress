Greetings! Thank you for visiting our website! We created this website for the Madison Academic Magnet High School Model U.N. club. In this club, students are involved in a simulated United Nations where they chose to represent countries from around the world. They take part in diplomatic talks, economic situations, and more.
Our website was created so that students have an easier way to access information about this club. This information includes upcoming events in the club as well as current events in the real UN that they can use to base their meetings off of. Our website also provides any students who are interested in joining the club a more convenient way of joining rather than trying to find the students who are already members.

<ul>
<li> The club previously lacked a website, and we saw an opportunity for Model UN to expand beyond their current members.</li>
<li> Despite the few members they had, very little information was known about the club around the school. Many of our students were not even aware that we had a Model UN club! We used this website as a way to spread the word about Model UN at Madison Academic.</li>
<li> We communicated with club leaders and the club administrator to better understand what they wanted on their website.</li>
Our home page consists of a javascript globe that we found on CodePen from the user @jorin. Also on our home page, we included a link to a soccer game that many of the Model UN members recommended we play during our coding breaks. We found this website to be so beneficial to our productivity that we decided to add it in to our final product as a fun way of showcasing something that meant so much to us as a group.
